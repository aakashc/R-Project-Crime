<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>In the recent years, crime against women in India particularly rape incidents have been reported extensively in the Indian media. These crimes are national phenomenon and are no longer rural India issues. Centuries have come and centuries have gone but the difficulty of women is not likely to change. Time has helplessly watched women suffering in the form of discrimination oppression exploitation degradation aggression humiliation. In Indian society woman occupies a vital position and venerable place. The Vedas glorified women as the mother the creator one who gives life and worshiped her as a ‘Devi or Goddess. But their glorification was rather mythical for at the same time in India women finds totally suppressed and dominated in a patriarchal society. Male violence against women is a worldwide phenomenon. There are various forms of crime against women. Sometimes it is even before birth some times in the adulthood and other phrases of life. Violence against women both inside and outside of their home has been a crucial issue in the contemporary Indian society. Women in India constitute near about half of its population and most of them are grinding under the socio-cultural and religious structures.
<br> On December 16 2012, a medical student in Delhi was brutally assaulted and gang-raped shading a spotlight on crimes against women in the country. For the first time, there was a furious outrage, emotional outburst as the general public, both men and women demanded safety and protection of women in the country. They were demanding changes to be made, a change in attitude towards women and a change in the demeaning gender laws that have not favored women for decades, plus they wanted a speedy justice to be executed on rapists so that they could be brought to book as soonest. However, many crimes of this nature occur every day in small towns and villages and do not get such attention. Crime is one of the main reasons that hinders women empowerment in India. Gender-based issues are getting worse. Women do not have equal status at home, at work or even in the society.<br>
<p>The main objectives of this project are to find out:</p>
<ul>
    <li>How total number of crimes against women in India have changed over the years at state level.</li>
    <li>What is the trend for each crime type.</li>
    <li>How can we rank states/cities based on total crimes/crime type/crime density.</li>
    <li>Are crimes correlated with state population/literacy rates.</li>
    <li>Which cities are safe and which are dangerous for women.</li>
</ul></p>    
    <h4>This study is carried out for the following crime types against Women:</h4>

        <p style='font-weight: 700'>I had specifically asked 15 questions from the given data and have arrived at the following conclusion:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Out of <strong>8</strong> crime types, <strong>7</strong> of them are increasing each year.</li>
            <li>Crime Rate increase is steady over the overs and increase rate is much more than the decrease rate.</li>
             <li><strong>Madhya Pradesh</strong> which has the large tribal population, tops <strong>rape</strong> and <strong>assault</strong> crimes.</li>
             <li>Many Indian cities have very high crime rates which makes it unsafe for women.</li>
             <li><strong>Delhi</strong>, the national capital is the most dangerous city for women based on total crime rates. Delhi ranks top in 5 out of 8 crime types.</li>
             <p>Generally, what has been happening in India has attracted the attention of the world as a whole, and only strict measures implemented by both the government and external forces can bring the change that women have yearned for. Strong laws should be enacted along with social awareness and women empowerment so that the crime rates can eventually come down and make India a safe place for women.</p>
